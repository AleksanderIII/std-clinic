                    <p> We have been helping herpes-positive patients for more than 17 years.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Once a herpes diagnosis is made, it’s typically followed by embarrassment, frustration, and even
                        anger. This article will explain why a newly diagnosed person shouldn’t jump to the conclusion
                        that infidelity by their current partner is to blame for their STD.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>How herpes is transmitted from one person to another is complex.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>People tend to scrutinize their life and especially their current relationship. They have a lot
                        of questions.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I was always careful; how could I get it?</li>
                        <li>Is my partner cheating on me?</li>
                        <li>Who gave it to me?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It’s outside the scope of this short article to discuss these questions in great detail, but we
                        can explain the most common scenarios that we’ve seen in our practice.

                    <p>Dr. Fuzayloff (his patients call him “Dr. F”) will briefly explain some possibilities.

                        <h2>Case #1. A person who didn’t know they had it passed it to their partner.</h2>
                        <p> A 25-year-old woman named Julia came to the office with a genital skin rash that she had
                            never had before. A herpes swab test came back positive for herpes (HSV-2).
                        </p><br>
                        <p>She confronted her boyfriend, Tony, whom she’d been dating for nine months.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Tony is a young professional who denied having sex outside of his current relationship with
                            Julia. He also said the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>He’s been fully tested for STDs after each relationship ended (and he’s had only three
                                carefully selected long-term partners in his life).
                            </li>
                            <li>He hasn’t ever had herpes symptoms.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We gave Tony the HSV-2 test (IgG), and it came back positive for herpes.
                        </p><br>
                        <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Julia got herpes from Tony. Though he’d never had any symptoms, he shed
                            the virus
                            silently.

                        <p><i>Julia contracted HSV-2 from James. I trusted Tony and I believe that he’s being honest

                            <li><i>It’s very common for people to have herpes and not know about it. Only 20% of
                                    herpes-positive people have symptoms. Most people are asymptomatic for life.</i>
                            </li>
                            <li><i>You don’t need to have a herpes outbreak to pass the infection. It can be passed

                                    silent herpes shedding. This means that James could have passed it to Julia without
                                    having symptoms.</i>

                                    didn’t
                                    show that herpes testing was performed.</i>

                        <p> Twenty-year-old Anna came to the office with a painful genital outbreak. A swab test
                            confirmed the diagnosis of herpes type 2 (HSV-2).
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Anna had just come out of a long-term relationship when she began dating Thomas. She and
                            Thomas have been together for more than six months. She suspected that she must have gotten
                            it from Thomas.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>We tested Thomas with blood work and his results came back negative for both herpes types.
                            Thomas began to suspect Anna of cheating on him.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Anna explained the following to us:

                        <ul>
                            <li>She has been in only two long-term relationships</li>

                            <li>She has never before had symptoms like this</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We tested her previous long-term partner, who turned out to be positive but had never had
                            symptoms
                        </p><br>
                        <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Anna got herpes from the previous partner but is just now having her first

                            swab; the results came back positive.

                        </p><br>
                        <p>They started arguing and accusing each other of cheating.

                            herpes to the other person. Most commonly, the doctor is not able to make this
                            determination.

                        <p>The take-home message is this: don’t be quick to judge, and don’t assume your partner has
                            cheated on you. From being in practice for a long time, we can assure you that most people
