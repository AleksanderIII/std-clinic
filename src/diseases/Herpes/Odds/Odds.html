                        doctors rely heavily on statistics for early diagnosis and
                        treatment. They tell doctors how common a condition is in general,
                        how easy it is to get an infection through a one-time contact or
                        through multiple contacts, the chance of contracting the infection
                        in different ways, and many other things.

                    Herpes shedding is a silent process without symptoms or visible
                    signs. We measure whether the virus has shed by seeing whether we
                    can isolate it on the skin (saliva, vaginal fluid, etc.) while the
                    patient is asymptomatic.

                    Please understand that these statistics are not for transmission,

                    how much a virus needs to be shedding for transmission to occur, but
                    it is believed that the higher the virus shedding rate, the greater
                    the chance of transmission.

                                    Herpes is transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact.
                                    If the skin of the person that has a herpes blister comes
                                    into contact with a partner’s skin, the blister might
                                    rupture, exposing the partner’s skin to fluid that contain
                                    high concentration of infection. During the herpes-positive
                                    person’s first outbreak the chance of transmission is
                                    greater because the concentration of the virus in the sores
                                    is much higher.

                                    Herpes prefers to enter the body through areas where the
                                    skin is thinner. In addition, skin abrasions are more common
                                    in the oral and genital areas. The thicker skin of the arms
                                    and torso is less penetrable.

                                        A blood test cannot tell us the location of the virus,
                                        only the type of herpes virus you have.

                                        We can’t say with certainty where the virus is located in
                                        patients who were diagnosed based on a blood test and have
                                        never had an outbreak. However, we can make an assumption
                                        based on statistics:
                                    </p>

                                            If you are positive for type 1 (HSV-1), it is most
                                            likely that it’s in the oral area (though it can be in
                                            the genital area).
                                        </li>

                                    <p>
                                        The only way to know the location of the virus for sure is
                                        to have an outbreak and test the visible sore with a swab
                                        at that time.
                                    </p>

                                        You are correct that the location of the virus in the body
                                        is important to know, because it’s stored locally and
                                        passed to other people through contact of the skin in that
                                        area to a partner’s skin.

                                        Once herpes is contracted, it stays in the body in a
                                        latent (suppressed) state.

                                        Unlike other viruses that the body’s immune system clears
                                        completely, the herpes virus is only suppressed by the
                                        immune system.

                                        Occasionally, certain triggers (sun, stress, and others)
                                        can activate the herpes virus so that it travels back to
                                        the skin, causing symptoms (blisters and sores). Sometimes
                                        the same triggers activate the herpes virus but without
                                        causing skin symptoms. This is called silent virus
                                        shedding. During those times, asymptomatic transmission
                                        might occur.

                                        It is still unclear to researchers exactly when shedding
                                        occurs, but most likely it is caused by the same triggers
                                        that induce a flare-up (outbreak) of the virus.

                                        It is believed to be more common in the first few years.
                                        As with flare-ups, the frequency of silent shedding is
                                        believed to go down over time. It is believed that silent
                                        transmission occur 4% of the time—so, on average, 14.5
                                        days in a year.

                                        The herpes virus is transmitted when the area where herpes
                                        resides while asymptomatic come into contact with your
                                        partner’s skin.

                                        If herpes (HSV-1 or HSV-2) was diagnosed based on a blood
                                        test (IgG) and you’ve never had a herpes outbreak, it’s
                                        impossible to tell where herpes is residing in your body
                                        while it’s inactive.

                                        Since both herpes types can affect both areas, the IgG
                                        test is only somewhat helpful. It doesn’t tell us the most
                                        important part—where herpes is residing in your body.
                                        Knowing the virus type (based on IgG blood test), we can
                                        make an assumption about where herpes is most likely to be

                                        average). This is about two-and-a-half times higher than
                                        the chance of herpes transmission from an infected female

                                        It’s easier for the herpes virus to enter the body through
                                        moist, thin skin areas such as the vaginal, rectal, and
                                        oral areas. The chance of transmission is greater if the
                                        exposed part of such areas is larger.

                                        There are no statistics available on the probability of
                                        herpes transmission via oral sex (at least, we couldn’t
                                        find any).

                                        What is known (estimated) is that the chance of getting
                                        herpes through receptive oral sex (that is, receiving oral
                                        sex from one’s herpes-positive partner) is about 1.5 times
                                        higher than through vaginal sex. In vaginal sex, the
                                        chance of herpes transmission per act is 2.3%. So,
                                        multiplying 1.5 by 2.3, we assume that the probability of
                                        per-act transmission for herpes infection via oral sex
                                        will be about 3.5%.

                                        There is a theoretical risk of getting the infection by
                                        sharing the utensils with someone with an active outbreak.
                                        However, in the real world the probability of this
                                        transmission is close to zero because when the virus is
                                        exposed to air it dies within a few hours. However, the
                                        WHO still recommends avoiding sharing an object that may
                                        contain saliva (cups, utensils, etc.) with someone who has
                                        an active herpes outbreak. The chance of passing herpes
                                        via utensils is extremely low.

                                            The herpes virus usually spreads through direct

                                            have to sit on the same exact spot shortly afterward

                                            seats because the sores are extremely sensitive
                                            (painful) and located in the genital area. People avoid

                                    herpes virus and pass it via skin-to-skin contact. Learn

                                        Yes, it is possible! Though the risk is low, herpes
                                        self-infection is possible via hand–genital–mouth contact.
                                        This means that a person may “transfer” the infection from
                                        the primary site of the outbreak (for example, the oral
                                        area) to other parts of the body (for example, the genital
                                        area or the eyes).
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        This is called autoinoculation. When it happens, it’s
                                        usually during a person’s first outbreak when there are a
                                        lot of sores and a high virus concentration. The chance of
                                        it occurring during subsequent outbreaks is lower.
                                    </p>

                                        Herpes does not travel through the body (for instance,
                                        through the blood or lymphatic system) to different areas.
                                        It must be transferred by direct contact.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />

                                        Here is how herpes transfer from one part to the other
                                        part of the body happens:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            A person touches oral sores during an outbreak and then
                                            touches another part of the body right away,
                                            transferring fluids containing a high concentration of
                                            virus to the other area.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The virus penetrates the skin and gets stored in the
                                            local nerve ganglion in the new area and becomes a new
                                            site where herpes outbreaks and transmission can occur.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                        Washing your hands with soap after touching the outbreak
                                        area eliminates the risk of herpes transmission.

                                        Yes, it is possible! And we believe (in our practice) that
                                        it’s common.

                                        We don’t know of any statistics about the chance of

                                        practice is that 50% of herpes-positive patients
                                        (especially with HSV-1):

                                        Note: The patients in our practice aren’t a big
                                        enough group to reach a definitive statistical conclusion.
                                    </p>

                                        This is the most common scenario where herpes is
                                        transmitted from parent to child:
                                    </p>

                                            A parent has a history of a “fever blister” and kisses
                                            their children playfully and bathes and cleans them
                                            while they’re small. Areas of the children’s skin that
                                            are most susceptible to herpes (transition skin areas
                                            that herpes prefers) are touched (eyelids, mouth,
                                            genitals).

                                            sores appear to a few days after they heal. Parents
                                            usually avoid touching their children while they have a
                                            sore, but not before and after.

                                            Moreover, transmission can happen during a silent
                                            shedding period when the parent is completely
                                            asymptomatic.
