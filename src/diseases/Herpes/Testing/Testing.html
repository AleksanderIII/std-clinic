                    Herpes testing: types, accuracy, timing, and necessity
                </h2>
                <p>In this section, we’ll give you information about herpes testing.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Testing is what ultimately establishes or rule out a diagnosis of
                    herpes. All the other we’ve talked about—what you feel, what you see,
                    and your odds of getting it—help us with the diagnosis, but they’ve
                    can’t establish it or confirm it.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    This section will summarize the different types of herpes tests, their
                    accuracy, how they’re interpreted, and when they’re necessary. Tables
                    with important statistics will be followed by FAQ answered by “Dr. F,”
                    an STD expert.

                    This table summarizes the overall accuracy of different herpes tests.
                    Please especially pay attention to the most common test, the IgG
                    test—and most importantly to its false positive and false negative
                    rates.

                    <li>
                        Test accuracy: how accurate is the test in detecting the herpes

                    <li>
                        False positive: the test detects the presence of herpes, but the
                        person doesn’t actually have it

                    <li>
                        False negative: the test doesn’t detect the presence of herpes, but

                    doing it at the right time. This means two things in the case of
                    herpes:

                                        Herpes testing is not a routinely performed test—it’s not a
                                        part of routine STD tests ordered by physicians. Moreover,
                                        this test might not be done when someone asks for a “full”
                                        or “complete” STD panel.

                                        According to the CDC, you should have herpes testing if:

                                    <p>
                                        Usually, screening tests are recommended when there is a
                                        high chance of a better outcome if a condition is diagnosed
                                        earlier. This is not the case with herpes. Herpes is a
                                        lifelong infection, and there is no change in treatment
                                        strategy or prognosis if someone is diagnosed early.

                                        According to the CDC, there is no proof of a herpes-positive

                                        protected sex, practicing abstinence) after learning about

                                        About 90% of people are herpes positive, and the majority of
                                        them—up to 80% of them—are unaware of that fact. They are
                                        asymptomatic and have no psychological or physical issues.
                                        However, once an asymptomatic person gets a positive result,
                                        they may start to feel stigmatized and ashamed, which will
                                        significantly lower their quality of life.

                                        The IgG test is also known as the herpes select test. It
                                        detects IgG antibodies for the two herpes types: HSV-1 and
                                        HSV-2. IgG antibodies are proteins made by the immune system
                                        that develop in response to infection. IgG tests can
                                        differentiate between the two herpes types.

                                        to perform. It is a simple blood test and is performed at
                                        various health clinics, diagnostic centers, and hospitals.

                                        IgG antibodies last for a lifetime. Therefore, a person may
                                        get tested at any time to find out if they have herpes. The
                                        only time restriction is that two weeks should pass after
                                        exposure if the test is being done to find out if the
                                        patient has recently contracted the virus.

                                        The IgG test may be performed on asymptomatic people, unlike
                                        swab (culture) tests, which should be performed within 48
                                        hours after the appearance of herpes-specific blisters and
                                        is most accurate if it is performed within the first 24
                                        hours.

                                        The IgG test is about 94% accurate in detecting the
                                        infection. About 19% of the time, its results are false
                                        positive (that is, the test is positive for herpes infection
                                        when the person does not have herpes).

                                        By contrast, the herpes IgM antibodies tests give almost 50%
                                        false-negative results. For that reason, the IgM antibodies
                                        test is not done for herpes screening ( link to this page

                                        First, I will mention a few test features that make this

                                        Unlike blood tests that check your body’s response to the
                                        virus, the HSV culture (swab) test detects the presence of
                                        the actual herpes virus in the sample (fluid and skin) taken
                                        directly from a herpes-specific lesion.

                                        It’s the only test that can tell if the lesion is a herpes
                                        lesion

                                        This is the only test that can tell you that the skin lesion
                                        you see is a herpes lesion, as opposed to something else. By
                                        comparison, from all herpes blood tests and a doctor’s
                                        physical exam, one can only assume that skin lesions are a
                                        herpes outbreak.

                                        The swab test is a very accurate test: if your results are
                                        positive, you can be 100% sure that you have herpes.

                                        Unlike blood tests, which can be done at any point to
                                        confirm one’s herpes status—the swab test can be performed
                                        only during an outbreak. Moreover, it should be done within
                                        the first 48 hours (ideally 24 hours) of seeing blisters and
                                        sores.

                                        Ideally the herpes blister that is swabbed should be broken
                                        by the doctor so concentrated fluid is collected for the
                                        testing. Dry sores cannot be swabbed.

                                        To choose the right test for you, you need to answer two
                                        questions:
                                    </p>

                                        <li>
                                            If you don’t have symptoms, how much time has passed since
                                            exposure?
                                        </li>

                                            If you have symptoms, you can get a culture test, which is
                                            the most accurate test for determining whether skin
                                            lesions are a herpes outbreak. (The symptom that we are
                                            talking about here is a skin blister or sore, not skin
                                            redness or other systemic symptoms (fever, tingling,
                                            fatigue, etc.).)

                                            The culture test has a few limitations:

                                                <li>
                                                    You should have a visible sore. Ideally the test
                                                    should be performed within 24 hours of the blisters’
                                                    appearance (it is OK to do it within 48 hours).

                                                    Ideally the herpes blister should be intact and broken
                                                    by a healthcare provider at the time of the test.

                                                    The sore should be wet. Dry, crusted sores cannot be
                                                    swabbed.

                                        are typically covered by health insurance.

                                        As with all available medical tests, herpes tests can give
                                        you false-negative results. The question is how often and
                                        when.
                                    </p>

                                        The definition of a “false negative” test is a test showing
                                        negative results when in reality you are positive for the
                                        disease. It means the test performed was not sensitive
                                        enough, for one reason or another, to pick up the infection.
                                    </p>

                                        It does not mean that the test is not accurate, but it
                                        should be done when certain conditions are met. Sometimes
                                        doctors do the test to see if it will come back positive; if
                                        the result is negative but they still think the patient
                                        probably has herpes, they know the test was not done under
                                        ideal conditions.

                                        probability cannot be precisely determined because it
                                        depends on various factors, such as the following:

                                        tests. But false-positive results can have a big
                                        psychological impact on some people who believe they have a
                                        condition that is not curable when in fact they don’t have
                                        it.

                                        False-positive results may be due to an overly sensitive and
                                        not specific enough test that picks up a condition that can
                                        cross-react.

                                        Here are the most practical and important details for each

                                            The herpes culture test (swab test) has a 0% chance of a
                                            false-positive test result. This means that a person who
                                            tests positive can be 100% sure that they have the herpes

                                            has up to a 19% probability of revealing false-positive
                                            test results. This mostly happens with a low positive
                                            number (less than 4).

                                        A long-term herpes study
                                        (https://sti.bmj.com/content/77/4/232) showed that if a
                                        person has a sufficient level of IgG antibodies, they will
                                        always have a detectable level of IgG antibodies, and if a
                                        person turned out to be IgG-negative in consecutive tests,
                                        that is merely due to a test error rather than a significant
                                        reduction of the IgG level (to the extent of becoming
                                        undetectable). Once a person is positive for herpes, they
                                        will stay positive for life.
                                    </p>

                                        The IgG antibody level increases with the amount of herpes
                                        virus in our body, but our immune system always tries to
                                        control the replication of the herpes virus. So, if a person
                                        has normally functioning immunity they will also have low
                                        levels of the herpes virus and stable levels of IgG
                                        antibodies. Any dysfunction of the immune system permits
                                        active replication of the herpes infection, resulting in
                                        increased levels of IgG antibodies.

                                        So, if a person has decreased immunity (due to stress,
                                        injury, pregnancy, HIV, chemotherapy, etc.), they are likely
                                        to have an increased amount of the herpes virus and higher
                                        IgG levels.

                                        Fluctuations of the IgG level are a common concern of
                                        patients. The assumption at this point is that the higher
                                        the IgG level, the higher the chance of an outbreak and the
                                        higher the chance of transmission to other people (“silent
                                        shedding” of the virus).

                                    What about discrepancies in different herpes tests: my herpes

                                        Different herpes tests are done for different reasons. Tests
                                        should be done under ideal circumstances, but that’s not
                                        always the case. It’s difficult to answer this question
                                        based on available data, but I will make some fair
                                        assumptions from available data to attempt to explain this.

                                        like herpes and it was tested with the swab test, the test
                                        is testing only the skin outbreak. It tells you only if the
                                        skin outbreak was caused by herpes. If it’s negative, it
                                        means only that that particular lesion wasn’t caused by
                                        herpes but rather by something else. You could still have
                                        herpes that’s latent.

                                        No, it is not important for a practicing physician. Here’s
                                        why:
                                    </p>
                                    <br />

                                        There are some differences between the two herpes types (for
                                        example, HSV-2 has more frequent outbreaks and is more
                                        easily transmittable than HSV-1, especially during the first
                                        three month after exposure). But in clinical medicine, it’s
                                        important to know information if it somehow changes the
                                        treatment strategy or something else that’s important. But
                                        in the case of herpes, the treatment plan and prognosis is
                                        the same for both types.

                                            a herpes-positive person has immunosuppression (people
                                            with HIV, people receiving chemotherapy, etc.), they won’t

                                            complications. This is true for both herpes types (they

                                            the virus in the body, not the type of herpes causing it.
                                            As we know, both herpes types may affect both the oral and
