                <h2>Common herpes myths </h2>
                <p>
                    Herpes is a common infection. There’s a lot of information available
                    on this topic and unfortunately a lot of misinformation—and hence a
                    lot of misconceptions that cause people who know they have it to feel
                    stigmatized.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    This section addresses the most common herpes myths (widespread
                    beliefs that are false) and the lack of scientific reasoning behind
                    them.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>So, let’s dive in!</p>
            </div>
            <div class='myth-content'>
                <h3>
                    Myth 1. HSV-1 means the oral area is affected and HSV-2 means the
                    genital area is affected
                </h3>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    This isn’t true. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can affect either the oral or
                    genital area.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class='section-text'>
                    Commonly, HSV-1 affects the oral area and HSV-2 affects the genital
                    area (that’s where their nicknames came from). However, the following
                    are facts:
                </p>
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>HSV-1 causes about 43% of herpes located in the genital area.</li>
                    <li>
                        HSV-2 rarely affects the oral area but it is possible to transmit
                        HSV-2 from the genital area to the oral area via oral-to-genital
                        sex.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Myth 2. Only “certain” people get herpes </h3>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    This isn’t true. Herpes affects everyone regardless of race, sexual
                    orientation, sexual activity, ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic
                    status.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class='section-text'>
                    It’s a fair statement that the more sexual partners you have, the more
                    likely it is that you’re herpes-positive.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class='section-text'>But both of the following are true:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p class='bold-text'>Virgins can have herpes</p>
                        <p class='section-text'>
                            Even though herpes has the stigma of being a sexually transmitted
                            disease, it can be transmitted in a nonsexual way. People can get
                            it from their friends and family members via touch, kissing, and
                            sharing utensils (this applies especially to HSV-1).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class='bold-text'>
                            A person who has had only one sexual partner can be
                            herpes-positive
                        </p>
                        <p class='section-text'>
                            Herpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2 together) affects up to 90% of people and
                            is easily transmitted via skin-to-skin contact. This means that
                            people who are sexually monogamous (conservative,
                            straitlaced—however you want to characterize them) can acquire the
                            herpes infection.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Myth 3. People always know when they have herpes</h3>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    Absolutely not! Only 20% of herpes-positive persons have ever had any
                    herpes-related symptoms or signs. That’s why most infected people are
                    unaware of their herpes status and continue to pass it to their sexual
                    partner(s) unknowingly.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class='section-text'>
                    As mentioned in the Testing section), it’s not a common practice to
                    test people for herpes. People are usually unaware of their herpes
                    status. Testing for herpes is mainly done when a person has some
                    symptoms (to rule out other more serious conditions) or when it’s
                    specifically requested at the time of the testing.
                </p>

                <h3>Myth 4. Herpes causes frequent painful outbreaks. </h3>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    Not true! Though herpes is a lifelong infection, the annual number of
                    outbreaks (if any) gradually decreases (herpes is a regressive
                    condition). And every outbreak tends to be less severe and shorter
                    than the last one.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class='section-text'>
                    (Unfortunately, these facts aren’t necessarily true for people with a
                    compromised immune system—those with advanced HIV or other
                    immunosuppressive conditions or who are receiving chemotherapy or
                    other medication that affects the immune system.)
                </p>

                <h3>Myth 5. A full (or complete) STD panel include herpes testing</h3>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    This isn’t true. The majority of clinics do not include herpes testing
                    when you undergo “full” or “complete” STD testing. Moreover, CDC does
                    not recommend getting tested for herpes unless you have herpes
                    symptoms or signs.
                </p>
                <p class='bold-text'>
                    Herpes testing is mainly done in these situations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You’re having a herpes outbreak and need to establish what’s causing
                        it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You’ve had a herpes-positive partner and want to know your herpes
                        status.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You’ve requested all possible STD tests and specifically asked that
                        HSV-1 and HSV-2 be included.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Myth 6. People with herpes can’t have “normal” kids </h3>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    This isn’t true. You can be herpes-positive and have “normal,” healthy
                    kids.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class='section-text'>
                    However, let’s talk about some facts about herpes and its effect on
                    reproduction:

                <p class='bold-text'>Effects of herpes on male fertility</p>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    Several studies have shown the negative effect of the herpes infection
                    on male fertility. Though herpes does not affect sperm’s quality, it
                    reduces sperm count (the number of reproductive cells in semen) by
                    almost 50% and may affect sperm motility (i.e., its ability to move).

                <p class='section-text'>
                    Herpes cannot be transmitted to a fetus (a baby inside the womb)
                    during pregnancy and does not cause any health problems to the unborn
                    child.

                <p class='section-text'>
                    Herpes can be passed during childbirth. Your gynecologist should be
                    aware of your herpes-positive status and carefully examine your
                    genital area before you give birth. They may ask you to consider a
                    C-section if you’re having an active outbreak to protect your baby
                    from exposure to herpes.
                </p>
                <h3>Myth 7. People with genital herpes can’t get oral sex </h3>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    This isn’t necessarily true. It depends on where the virus is residing
                    in your body. Both types of the herpes virus can affect either the
                    oral or genital area. Yes, it’s true that type 1 mostly affects the
                    oral area and type 2 mostly affects the genital area, but that’s not
                    necessarily the case.
                </p>
                <h3>Myth 8. Passing herpes to family members is inevitable</h3>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    No! Herpes is an extremely common condition but it’s not easily passed
                    to members of your household because the herpes virus can’t survive
                    for very long outside the body. Here is a short overview of herpes
                    transmission to household members:
                </p>
                <p class='bold-text'>When you have symptoms</p>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    Nonsexual herpes transmission happens mainly when an infected person
                    has herpes symptoms. The skin with the sores must come into contact
                    with another person’s skin. There is a low risk of passing it via
                    sharing utensils, kissing, or touching.
                </p>
                <p class='bold-text'>
                    To protect your family members, the following are recommended:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Wash your hands with soap right after you touch your blisters or
                        sores.
                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid sharing utensils during outbreaks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class='bold-text'>
                    When you have no symptoms
                </p>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    If you’re herpes-positive but you have herpes-related signs and
                    symptoms, the chance of herpes transmission non-sexually is almost
                    zero.
                </p>
                <h3>Myth 9. Herpes can’t be transmitted if you use protection </h3>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    This isn’t true. You can pass herpes even if you use protection.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class='section-text'>
                    Condoms reduce the chance that you’ll pass herpes by only 50% (there’s
                    up to a 10% transmission risk using condoms and up to a 20%
                    transmission risk not using condoms) because areas of the skin that
                    aren’t covered by a condom may contain herpes virus and pass it via
                    skin-to-skin contact.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class='section-text'>
                    If you have oral herpes, you can transmit it via a kiss or unprotected
                    oral sex.
                </p>
                <h3>Myth 10. Herpes can be passed only during an outbreak </h3>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    Not necessarily! Though the chance of symptomatic transmission is
                    higher than the chance of asymptomatic transmission, you can transmit
                    the infection via direct skin-to-skin contact (20.1% vs. 10.2%). (Even
                    when you’re not having symptoms, the virus still lives in your body.)
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class='section-text'>
                    Seventy-five percent of herpes transmissions occurs on outbreak-free
                    days because of what’s called silent shedding. Read more about it in
                    the “Odds of getting herpes section.”
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Myth 11. HSV-1 is transmitted orally and HSV-2 is transmitted
                    genitally
                </h3>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    Not necessarily. To know what part of your body transmits herpes, you
                    need to know where the virus resides in your body (where it’s stored).
                </p>
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For herpes transmission to occur, the area of your skin where the
                        virus resides must come into contact with your partner’s skin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transmission usually happens during an outbreak but it can happen
                        between outbreaks too.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    Here are a few important things to keep in mind about herpes testing
                    and what it can tell you about the location of herpes in your body:
                </p>
                <p class='bold-text'>
                    A blood test cannot identify the location of herpes
                </p>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    A blood test can tell you the type of herpes you have but not the
                    location of the virus inside your body. You can only make assumptions
                    based on the herpes type and general statistics for that type: HSV-1
                    is mainly in the oral area and HSV-2 is mainly in the genital area.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class='section-text'>
                    <b>Example:</b> You may test positive for
                    HSV-2 (so-called genital herpes) through a blood test but have herpes
                    outbreaks exclusively in your oral area. This would mean that you got
                    the “genital” form (HSV-2) in your oral area. Please keep in mind that
                    you could have gotten it from sex (this is more common) or in a
                    nonsexual way.
                </p>
                <p class='bold-text'>
                    Only testing of an actual outbreak can determine what part of your
                    body the herpes virus lives in.
                </p>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    If you have an outbreak and have it tested with a swab test (herpes
                    PCR or herpes culture), then you will know the location of the virus,
                    the type of virus causing it, and the way you will pass it to other
                    people. Again, for transmission to occur, that skin area (oral or
                    genital) must come into contact with your partner’s skin. Transmission
                    can occur at the time of the outbreak (this is more common) or at any
                    other time.
                </p>
                <h3>Myth 12. If you have herpes, it’s the end of your sex life </h3>
                <p class='section-text'>
                    No! Even though you can pass the herpes infection through sex, you
                    need to be aware of the following:
                </p>
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Herpes is an extremely widespread infection and a lot of people are
                        herpes-positive (there is a high chance that your partner also has
                        it).
                    </li>
                    <li>Herpes is not a life-threatening condition.</li>
                    <li>
                        You can diminish the chance of passing it by doing the following:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Using protection during sex (this decreases the chance of herpes
                                transmission by 30%–50%)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Taking antiviral medications (this decreases the chance of
                                herpes transmission by 50%)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Avoiding having sex during outbreaks (this decreases the chance
                                of herpes transmission by 50%)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
